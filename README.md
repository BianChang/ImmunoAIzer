# ImmunoAIzer
A computational framework for cell distribution and gene mutation prediction in tumor microenvironment

This repo is the pytorch implementation of the following paper:
[ImmunoAIzer: A deep-learning-based computational framework to characterize cell distribution and gene mutation in tumor microenvironment] <br/>

The code are heavily borrowed from a pytorch implementation: [Adversarial Learning for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07934) and [Link](https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100)  <br/>

## Prerequisite

* CUDA/CUDNN
* pytorch 1.3.1
* python 3.6.9

## More details will be uploaded after this paper is published
